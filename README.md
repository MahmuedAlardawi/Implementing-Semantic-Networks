# Exploring Semantic Nets for Knowledge Representation - Project Overview

## Introduction
This project, undertaken by students from King Abdulaziz University's CPCS-331 Artificial Intelligence course, aims to implement and evaluate semantic networks for knowledge representation. Using a university system as a domain, the project demonstrates how complex relationships within a large system can be modeled using semantic nets.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Network Implementation**: Utilizes semantic networks to represent and manage knowledge as interconnected nodes and relationships.
- **Flexible Domain Application**: Although demonstrated on a university system, the designed semantic net is adaptable to other domains.
- **Graph Operations**: Includes functionalities for adding, removing, and modifying nodes and relationships within the semantic net.
- **Visualization**: Leverages Python libraries like NetworkX and Matplotlib to visually represent the semantic net and its modifications.
- **Interactive Queries**: Supports queries for exploring relationships, checking existence of nodes, and extracting network subgraphs.

## Technical Requirements

- **Python Libraries**: Uses NetworkX for graph management and Matplotlib for visualization.
- **Interactive Demonstrations**: Includes code snippets and visualization scripts that highlight the network's capabilities and response to various operations.

## Objective

To provide a practical exploration of semantic networks as a method of knowledge representation, illustrating the method's effectiveness in organizing and querying complex information systems. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding semantic nets and their applications in artificial intelligence.

## How to Use

1. **Environment Setup**: Instructions for setting up the Python environment with necessary libraries.
2. **Running the Demonstrations**: Step-by-step guide on how to execute the provided Python scripts to visualize the semantic network.
3. **Interacting with the Network**: How to use the provided functions to manipulate and query the semantic net.
4. **Modifying the Network**: Guide on adding or removing nodes and edges, and reflecting these changes visually.

This README provides an in-depth guide to navigating and utilizing the functionalities of the semantic net implementation for educational and research purposes.
